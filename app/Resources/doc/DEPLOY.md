# Deploying

Graviton supports Cloudfoundry out of the box.

You need to define a mongodb service before pushing. Check ``manifest.yml`` for it's name and
redefine as needed.

Pushing to the cloud will push the bare code and run ``composer install`` on the target. 
Currently cloud installs get populated with mongodb fixtures on each start for ease of deployment.

```bash
cf push graviton
```

## Loading fixtures in cloudfoundry.

Add the connection data from ``vcap_services.mongodb-2.2[0].credentials.url``
to ``app/config/parameters_local.xml`` but replace the ``<ip>:<port>``
part with ``localhost:8001``.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">
  <parameters>
    <parameter key="mongodb.default.server.uri">mongodb://user:pass@127.0.0.1:8001/db</parameter>
  </parameters>
</container>
```

Open a local connection using the service connector console.  To
do this you will need to have the ``SwisscomPlugin`` installed in
your ``cf`` command. I'm not currently aware of where I can link to
that and your cloudfoundry might not even support it. 

Look at the following two command to get started opening a tunnel
to cf.
``bash
cf help sc
cf env graviton
cf sc connect 8001 <args from env output as needed>
``

Load the fixtures using app/console.

``bash
php app/console doctrine:mongodb:fixtures:load
``

You can also connect to your mongodb with other clients for maintenance
purposes.
